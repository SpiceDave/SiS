Template notes
------------------
Template number refers to PRD

AddThis component found on two of the templates is using a personal test account created to test for placement etc. SiS need to supply correct info.

Twitter iFrame url will change as this is only for developement purposes 

Error messages are hidden but are wrapped in a class .error, display:none; 

There are other hidden layers on some of the pages containing alternative states described in the PRD

All xhtml templates have been validated with w3c validator. There are some errors that relate to code sourced from YouTube and Facebook for certain functionality.

There are three img directories, ui - images generally used for static content, dummy - for dynamic content. Product display boxes should accomodate slighly different size images if required. There is a seperate directory for email images containing those required for static and dynamic content - there are only 5 or 6 in total.

Mini Basket component is contained in a separate file and pulled in using AJAX on rollover of the appropriate area for demonstrative purposes.

Quick buy layer is contained in the footer section.

Video layer pulls content from main page using in numeric identifier, so should be quite easy to implement from RED's perspective using a loop - Template as supplied links to the same YT video for each video item.
